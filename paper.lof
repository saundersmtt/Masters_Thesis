\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces Order parameters of lipid chains. Sn$_2$\nobreakspace {}and Sn$_2$\nobreakspace {}refer to the two lipid tails. The carbon numbering starts from the polar carbon at the ester bond; however, we do not calculate an $S_{CD}$ for the first carbon as this carbon would not have a hydrogen attached in an ester-linked lipid. This convention was maintained for the ether-linked lipid. The unsaturated bond is between carbons 9 and 10 on the $\text {Sn}_2$ chain. In both chains, HOPC shows higher ordering, except for the unsaturated carbons on the 9-octadecene chain. This ordering corresponds with the lower area per lipid of the HOPC bilayer, values of which can be seen in table\nobreakspace {}\ref {tab:struc}. \relax }}{20}{figure.caption.9}%

Densities are computed by dividing the box dimension along the membrane normal into 2000 slices. Error bars are indicated for every 10th slice. We note that sodium ions have a broader distribution in POPC than in HOPC. The peak of the Na\textsuperscript {+}\nobreakspace {}distribution in POPC is also closer to the center of the bilayer than in HOPC. This may be due to the interaction of ions with the carbonyl oxygens (shown in red) that are present in POPC but absent in HOPC. In both bilayers, the chloride ions gather near the positively charged choline trimethylammonium, shown in blue. The inset shows the distribution of ions in the transitional region from the bilayer surface to bulk solvent. As one looks further out from the bilayer, the density of Na\textsuperscript {+}\nobreakspace {}and Cl\textsuperscript {-}\nobreakspace {}equalize, as is expected in bulk solvent. \relax }}{21}{figure.caption.10}%

The box is symmetrized around the bilayer center, and thus only half the box is shown. Standard deviations are calculated by dividing the trajectory into over 5ns blocks. The dashed vertical lines in the $P_2$ plot are demarkations for the different spatial regions, $B_{-1}$, $B_{+}$, $B_{-2}$, and $B_\text {bulk}$, as discussed in the associated text. $P_1$ is the average of the first legendre polynomial of the cosine of the angle between the bilayer normal and the O-H bond vector of each water molecule per box slice. $P_2$ is the average of the second legendre polynomial.

We also see a large peak in the HOPC system, and a large trough that is not present in POPC. The larger peak at the bilayer surface may provide a barrier to solvent and dissolved ions, and the trough may be a trap that causes the buildup of solvent in the bilayer headgroup region. \relax }}{26}{figure.caption.16}%
